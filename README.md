# Simple Chat App

### About:

This is a real-time chat application built using React, React on the frontend with MUI and NodeJS/Express Backend. I also added a mysql for the database.
Note that the database being used is free and it has some limitations and is not recomended for production use except for testing.
It also requires internet to be used to connect from the database online.
Moreover, the app is not yet deployed online because it still have some limitation.

Users are able to login and message other users in real-time.
it uses cookies, so that the user is still logged in after refresh
